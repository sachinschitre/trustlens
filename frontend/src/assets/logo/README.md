## Logo Concept

The TrustLens logo combines:
- **AI Eye Lens**: Central circular element representing AI vision and analysis
- **Blockchain Circuit**: Outer ring with nodes and connections representing blockchain technology
- **Trust Colors**: Blue to cyan gradient representing trust, security, and technology

## Design Principles

- **Minimalist**: Clean, simple design that works at any size
- **Adaptive**: Automatically adjusts colors for light/dark themes
- **Scalable**: Vector-based SVG that scales perfectly
- **Professional**: Suitable for investor presentations and production use

## Brand Guidelines

- Use the full logo (icon + text) for headers and branding
- Use the icon only for favicons and small spaces
- Use the text only for text-only contexts
- Always maintain proper spacing and proportions
- Do not modify colors or distort the logo
